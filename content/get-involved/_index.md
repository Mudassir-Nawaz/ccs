### Meet Amina: Her Day Begins Before the Sun Rises
At just seven years old, Amina’s hands are already rough from
carrying bricks.
Each morning, before the sun peeks over the horizon in rural
Pakistan, she walks barefoot to the kiln where she and her mother
stack, lift, and haul heavy clay blocks. There is no school. No
breakfast. Just work.

She watches other children walk past—books in hand, laughter in
their voices—and wonders what a pencil feels like.
Her world is silent except for the sounds of labor.
Her future, uncertain.

But it doesn’t have to stay that way.

### One Subscription Can Rewrite Her Story
For less than the cost of a few monthly subscriptions—Netflix, Hulu,
or SiriusXM—you can give Amina something she’s never had.
