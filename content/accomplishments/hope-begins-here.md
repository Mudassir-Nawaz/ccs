In a corner of Pakistan where poverty and child slavery rob
children of their futures, something extraordinary is happening.

A small but mighty Christian community has opened the doors of
**a two-room school**, and with it, a new chapter of hope and
freedom is being written for over **50 children**.

These are children who, until recently, faced lives of
hardshipâ€”many born into generational poverty, some trapped in
forced labor at brick kilns or fields. Education, health, and safety
were not dreams they dared to imagine.

**But now, they have a school.**
