The Christian community didn’t wait for perfect conditions. They
acted. With faith, commitment, and compassion, they established a
humble but fully functional school that provides:

- **Free education** to children who would otherwise never step
inside a classroom
- **Nutritious meals** that fuel learning and growth
- **Basic healthcare support** to monitor and improve children’s
physical well-being
- **Transportation** to ensure even the most vulnerable children
can attend safely
- **Books and learning materials** so every child can read,
write, and dream
- **Trained teachers** who nurture not just minds, but hearts
- **Security guards** to protect children in a region where safety
cannot be taken for granted

**More Than a School—A Lifeline**
